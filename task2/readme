Write a function to convert a name into initials. This function strictly takes two words with one space in between them.
The output should be two capital letters with a dot seperating them.

It should look like this:

Sam Harris => S.H
Patrick Feeney => P.F


Advanced:
Sam => S
Patrick Feeney => P.F
Neil Patrick Harris => N.P.H

N.P.H => N.P.H
S => S
S.H => S.H
